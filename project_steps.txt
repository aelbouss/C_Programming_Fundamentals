1  - read infile for  execute its  content  by  the first cmd1
2 - create a pipe to pass  result  into  the cmd2
3 - redirect the stdout in p1 into  the  write end of the pipe
4 - execute the  cmd1 
5 - create an other  process  to the  cmd2 .
6 - redirect  the  stdin and  let  cmd2 to  read from the  pipe's  
read end
7 - execute the cmd2

the  current steps : 
- search for the  program that the user  enter  if  it  exists return its  full path 

steps : 
 split  the  program  (path env var) .  (get the  path = ok )
 search  for  the  path
